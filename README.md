# YouTube Clone with Extras

This project is a clone of YouTube, created as my first venture into web development using HTML and CSS. It's a personal project based on a tutorial, enhanced with additional features to practice and demonstrate my front-end development skills.

## Project Overview

The YouTube Clone project is built by closely following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc&t). While the core structure mimics the familiar interface of YouTube, I have added extra elements and custom styling to go beyond the basics and create a unique user experience.

## Features

- A replica of YouTube's core layout using HTML and CSS.
- Custom enhancements and design elements for a distinctive look.
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with HTML and CSS.
- Understood the fundamentals of web layout and responsive design.
- Explored the process of building a web application from a design template.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view the project.
